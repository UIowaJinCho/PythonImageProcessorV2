# UnderwaterFilterV2

This is a python image processor based on cv2(opencv-python).

**You will have to either drag the folder into the VSCode or if you are using terminal, you have to locate yourself at the UnderwaterFilterV2 folder exactly to work with the driver.**

1. In the **ImageFilter** folder, in **Filter.py** if you declare your image processing logic in the matching syntax, it will show up in the prompt automatically.
2. You can change the input images by changing the files in the **OriginalPhotos** folder.
3. Output images will be stored in corresponding sub-folders in the **ProcessedPhotos** folder.
